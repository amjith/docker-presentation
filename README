These are the demo recordings of docker presentation that I gave at PyCon 2014 and DjangoCon EU 2014 (Django Island). 

You need to install `playitagainsam` (https://github.com/rfk/playitagainsam) in order to run these demos. 

* pip install playitagainsam
* pias replay basic_demo0
* pias replay dockerfile_demo1
